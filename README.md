# docker-ckpool

Run your own ckpool solo instance in a docker container

## First steps

1. Install Docker (see https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ for details)
2. Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/SatoshiNakamotoBitcoin/ckpool-docker.git`
3. Build the container image with `./build_image.sh` or use a custom build command: `docker build -t ckpool-docker:latest .`

### Configuration
The pool configuration file is located in conf/ckpool.conf
 - Amend the pool configuration for your bitcoind instance. For a local instance, you just need to set the correct RPC credentials.
 - Set the donation rate and address - or even disable donation.

`donaddress=<BTC_ADDRESS>`

`donrate=1 (-> 1% donation)`

`donrate=0 (-> disable donation)`

 
To make a local bitcoind available to the docker container, add these two lines to bitcoin.conf to bind it to the docker host gateway address:

`rpcbind=172.17.0.1`

`zmqpubhashblock=tcp://172.17.0.1:28332`

### Container quick-start

- Create and start the container with `docker compose up -d`

- To stop the container use `docker compose stop`
- To start the container use `docker compose start`

- Whenever you need to change the ckpool configuration, stop the container first. Once done with your changes, start the container again.

- To destroy the container (if needed), use `docker compose down`

### Connect to ckpool

By default, the ckpool container is listening on port 3333. Depending on your setup, either use localhost or the IP address of the docker host in the stratum URL to connect your miners:

`stratum+tcp://localhost:3333`

OR

`stratum+tcp://<HOST_IP>:3333`
